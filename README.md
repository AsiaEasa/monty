-Monty is a programming language that may not be as widely discussed as some other languages, but it presents a unique blend of features that cater to both scripting and conventional programming needs.

-An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in a high-level language, without converting it into machine code. In programming, we can execute a program in two ways. Firstly, through compilation and secondly, through an interpreter. The common way is to use a compiler.

-Monty Bytecode Files : These files typically have the ".m" extension and contain a series of instructions that the Monty interpreter will execute. Each line in a Monty bytecode file represents a single instruction.

-A stack is a linear data structure where you can only add new elements and remove existing ones from the same end, which we call the "top" of the stack. This follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element you put in is the first one to come out.

-A queue is a linear data structure where the components are put into one end and removed from the other end according to the "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) principle. Enqueue (add an element to the back) and dequeue (remove an element from the front) are two queue operations.
